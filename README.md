# MTRN4110_Phase_D
As of 08/08/2021
- Combined_controller is the basic combination of Phase A & B - barely modified so far
- The controller `Phase_D_dyanmic_planning` is for Adam's intial attempt at dynamically updating the path upon detecting an unforseen wall
- `Eigen` folder has been copied into the combined_controller's directory for the Phase A stuff to work
- Phase C vision `.ipynb` notebook is in the `controllers` folder
- 3 worlds currently in the `worlds` folder: two from phase C for getting the target, once from Terry's phase A for the adjustments to the robot - ideally we want to combine these into world files that work for the whole of Phase D
